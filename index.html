                <p>This website is going to act as a starting point for my interest in coding. Over time, I'll improve it, and build it into something that really catches your eye. For now, please excuse the simplicity. I'm still learning!</p>

                <h3>How I Got Started</h3>
                <p>I guess I can talk about how I'm currently learning to code, and where I plan to go with it. I have tried to learn to code for a couple years now. My interest for it originally started back in 2022, when I was working in a dead-end retail job. I started looking at ways I can improve myself, and my skills, to get a job that actually meant something. <br><br>At first, I was really stuck, as I was only 19, and still figuring everything out. I didn't even know where to start. I had always liked gaming, and technology in general, but for some reason, I never studied it after high school. I studied ICT at GCSE level, and got an A, so the signs were there early. It might be down to the fact that nobody else in my family was interested in tech, so they didn't really push me towards it.<br><br>Anyway, I started watching YouTube videos on how to code, which generally covered Python. I coded along with a few of these videos, but found myself being completely stuck when I came to code by myself. I needed something with more structure, and direction. Something I can work through, that I actually remember. I started with freeCodeCamp, working through their Responsive Web Design certification, but found myself lacking interest after a few weeks. I decided to change, and gave The Odin Project a go. Again, I found that I lost interest after a few weeks passed.<br><br>I ended up getting a job in IT, and stopped coding completely up until now (May 2024, 1.5 years since I got the job). I was more focused on developing my IT skills (troubleshooting, technical knowledge, customer service) than my coding skills. I've reached a point in IT where I want to diversify my skills. My interest for coding has been reignited, and I've made more progress than I ever did when I worked in my retail job.<br><br>Honestly, I think it's because I have rewired my brain to crave improvement, always. This leads me to seek ways to build up all my technological skills, whether it be coding, scripting, cybersecurity, networks, desktops, I want to be good at it all. I want to be <i>that guy</i> when it comes to technology.</p>
